ofxSimpleGuiToo changelog

TODOs
--------------------
- a time based graph control that can for example visualize perlin noise
- a range control (two sliders)
- non boundary sliders similar to the draggable number boxes in max msp
- increment / decrement for 2d slider
- a file selection combo box
- advanced and basic flag per control >> switching the gui between basic and advanced mode hides or displays controls

- text input is still flaky, especially in terms of deselecting and cursor functionality
- auto save doesn't work on text input


modifications by Mark 27/02/2011
--------------------
- fixed problem with keyboard shortcuts (e.g. right arrow triggered fullscreen 'f' keyboard shortcut)
- fixed problem with adding several controls with same name to the same page (now the keys get automatically incremented)


modifications by Mark 22/01/2011
--------------------
- added text input control
- added new keyboard shortcut functionality used in conjunction with buttons >> addButton(name, keyboardShortcut, listener, method)
- enable / disable keyboard shortcuts (mainly for disabling other shortcuts while using text input)
- added default "Keyboard Shortcuts" page (all buttons with keyboard shortcuts will also be added to this page. Mainly to check any overlapping keyboard shortcuts)

modifications by Mark
--------------------
- changed appearance here and there
- keyboard editing of slider values (rightmouse click to toggle keyboard editing, slightly rudimentary at the moment)
- added debug controls just to display variables without being able to change them
- added shift increment to sliders (larger increment)
- changed sizing and colouring of slider2d
- disable saving to xml using includeInXml flag (on by default)


v1.3
--------------------
- page::saveToXML() pushed the <controls> tag so control::saveToXML() didn't need to check that tag, 
  whereas page::loadFromXML() didn't push the <controls> tag so control::loadFromXML() did.
  Wasn't consistent so now all controls can assume that we are already inside the <controls> tag.
- fixed keyboard support (any control which the mouse is hovering over, now receives the events:
     keyPressed(int key), keyReleased(int key), onKeyUp(), onKeyDown(), onKeyLeft(), onKeyRight(), onKeyEnter()
  
v1.2
--------------------
- lots of thing, can't remember. whoops.


v1.1	07/04/2009
--------------------
- changed license to revised BSD (a lot more more permissive than GPL)


v1.0
--------------------
- initial version
- changes from original ofxSimpleGui
	- added pages (tabs), controls are added to pages
	- when controls reach bottom of page (customizable using page.height property) controls flow to the right
	- ability to customize spacing / sizes / colors etc. using a configuration class
	- everything on a grid
	- addFrame has been renamed to addContent and manages any class type which extends ofBaseDraws
